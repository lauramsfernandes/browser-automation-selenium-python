This repository is about my hands on experience during the `Elegant Browser Automation with Python and Selenium` course by Brendan Blair from Texas Academy.

I highly recommend his course if you are interested in automation. It is a high standart course and the plus is he is the funniest guy. It's impossible to get bored.
