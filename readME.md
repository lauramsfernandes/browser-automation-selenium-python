This repository is about my hands-on experience during the `Elegant Browser Automation with Python and Selenium` course by Brendan Blair from Texas Academy.

I highly recommend his course if you are interested in automation. It is a professional standart course and the best part is he is the funniest guy (please read: impossible to get bored).

I will not put here all the content of the course, just what call my attention to my specific case so that I can access it later, if I need to.

If you are interested in the course, the link is below.
